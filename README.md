**Important:** do not rely on the API until the stable version 1.0 is released as it is still subject to change!

## About ThunderSTORM
[ThunderSTORM](http://zitmen.github.io/thunderstorm/) is an open-source, interactive, and modular plug-in for [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) designed for automated processing, analysis, and visualization of data acquired by single molecule localization microscopy methods such as PALM and STORM. Our philosophy in developing [ThunderSTORM](http://zitmen.github.io/thunderstorm/) has been to offer an extensive collection of processing and post-processing methods so that users can easily adapt the process of analysis to their data.

## Getting started
Currently the most simple approach to link our library to your project is using JitPack. Look [here](https://jitpack.io/#zitmen/thunderstorm-algorithms) for the instructions.
